# Social Network API

## Motivation
As part of the UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, I built an API for a social network web application where users can share thoughts, react to thoughts posted by friends, and manage a friends list.

## Tech Used
We're in the NoSQL section of the bootcamp, so a main component of this project is using Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database. Other tech includes Express.js

## Demonstration Videos
The challenge requires thorough documentation in the form of demonstration videos. So here are 4 videos recorded to demonstrate the full functionality of the application:
