# Social Network API

## Motivation
As part of the UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, I built an API for a social network web application where users can share thoughts, react to thoughts posted by friends, and manage a friends list.

## Tech Used
We're in the NoSQL section of the bootcamp, so a main component of this project is using Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database. Other tech includes Express.js

## Demonstration Videos
The challenge requires thorough documentation in the form of demonstration videos. So here are 4 videos recorded to demonstrate the full functionality of the application:

### Part 1
* Links to videos:
  * Part 1, Format 1 - mp4 on Google Drive - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IAoGkofYtNBUGnc4KNEvxiarKrIWzZ4a/view?usp=sharing
  * Part 1, Format 2 - webm file extension from Screencastify on Google Drive - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OL7H7fx7MHufgWzM6Ae5QjwcLU8GKpSg/view?usp=sharing
  * Why two formats? At the time of this posting, viewing directly within Google Drive is glitching, so I'm adding two types of formats to offer choice to route around possible ongoing viewing glitches (for example, the mp4 can be downloaded vs viewed in browser if needed)
* Length of video: 4:35
* Topics covered: 
  * All of the technical acceptance criteria being met 
  * How to start the applicationâ€™s server
  * GET routes for all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia Core
  * GET routes for a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia Core
  * POST routes for users
